# Machine Learning ZoomCamp: Session - Car Price Prediction Model

## 01 Introduction

This session focuses on a hands-on project to implement a car price prediction model. This addresses the scenario introduced in Session 1, where the goal is to help users of online classified websites determine the best price for their cars.

### Project Overview

**Problem:** Users want to sell their cars but need assistance in determining a fair and competitive price.

**Solution:** Develop a machine learning model that predicts car prices based on various features.

**Dataset:**  We will use a dataset from Kaggle containing car prices and features (https://www.kaggle.com/).

**Dataset Features:** The dataset includes various car characteristics, such as:

* **Make:** The manufacturer of the car.
* **Model:** The specific model of the car.
* **Year:** The year the car was manufactured.
* **Engine:** Details about the car's engine.
* **Other Properties:** Fuel type, mileage, etc.
* **Target Variable:** MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) - This is the value we want to predict.

### Project Plan:

1. **Data Acquisition and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Download the dataset from Kaggle.
    * Analyze the data to understand its structure, features, and relationships.

2. **Data Preparation:**
    * Clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for model training.

3. **Model Training (Linear Regression):**
    * Train a linear regression model using the prepared dataset to predict car prices.

4. **Linear Regression Implementation:**
    *  Dive deeper into the implementation details of linear regression.
    *  Implement the algorithm from scratch to gain a deeper understanding.

5. **Model Evaluation (RMSE):**
    *  Evaluate the model's quality using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 
    *  RMSE is a metric that measures the difference between predicted and actual values.

6. **Feature Engineering:**
    *  Create new features from existing ones to improve model accuracy. 
    *  Example: Combining "Year" and "Mileage" to create an "Age-Weighted Mileage" feature.

7. **Handling Numerical Stability (Regularization):**
    *  Address numerical stability problems encountered during model training.
    *  Introduce the concept of regularization and how it helps prevent overfitting.

8. **Model Deployment:**
    *  Utilize the trained and optimized model for making predictions on new car data.

### Code and Resources:

* All code for this session is available in a GitHub repository: [Insert Link to Github Repo Here]
* The repository contains:
    * A Jupyter Notebook with the complete code walkthrough.
    * The CSV file containing the car price dataset.

### Next Steps:

* We will begin by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the CSV dataset.
* This involves loading the data, examining its structure, and visualizing relationships between variables. 
* Through EDA, we can gain insights that will guide our data preparation and model building process. 

## 02 Data Preparation for Price Prediction

**Introduction**

This lesson focuses on preparing a dataset for a car price prediction project. The dataset is available on Kaggle, but a copy is also accessible on the instructor's GitHub repository:

- Repository: [ML-Zoomcamp-code](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code)
- Path: chapter-02-car-price/data.csv

**Downloading the Data**

- The instructor recommends using `wget` or the browser's "Save As" function to download the `data.csv` file.
- He notes that he already has the file downloaded.

**Loading the Data**

- Pandas' `read_csv` function is used to load the CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- The DataFrame is displayed to show the same data viewed previously on Kaggle.
- The DataFrame is assigned to a variable.

**Initial Data Exploration**

- The `head()` method is used to examine the first five rows of the DataFrame.
- The DataFrame contains various features (characteristics) of cars, including manufacturer, model, year, etc.
- The target variable to predict is `MSRP` (Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price).

**Data Cleaning - Column Names**

- **Inconsistency:** The instructor points out inconsistencies in column names:
    - Some names use underscores, others don't.
    - Some names contain spaces, which can cause issues when accessing columns using dot notation.
- **Standardization:**  The goal is to make the column names consistent by:
    - Converting all names to lowercase.
    - Replacing spaces with underscores.
- **Implementation:**
    - The `columns` attribute of the DataFrame is used to access the column names (which is a Pandas Index).
    - Pandas Index objects have a `.str` accessor for string manipulation.
    - The `lower()` method is applied to convert all column names to lowercase.
    - The `replace()` method is used to replace spaces with underscores.
    - The modified column names are assigned back to the `columns` attribute.
- **Verification:** The `head()` method is used again to confirm that the column names are now standardized.


**Data Cleaning - String Values**

- **Inconsistency:** Similar inconsistencies are observed in string values within the DataFrame (e.g., some values are all caps, others are not).
- **Standardization:** The goal is to standardize these values as well.
- **Identifying String Columns:**
    - The `dtypes` attribute is used to get the data type of each column.
    - Columns with the `object` dtype are considered string columns in this context.
    - A boolean mask is created to select columns where `dtype == object`.
    - The `index` attribute of the resulting Series is used to get the names of the string columns.
    - The names are converted to a Python list and assigned to a variable called `strings`.
- **Standardizing String Values:**
    - A loop iterates through the `strings` list (names of string columns).
    - Within the loop, the same string manipulation as with column names is applied to each string column:
        - Convert to lowercase.
        - Replace spaces with underscores.
    - The modified values are assigned back to the respective columns in the DataFrame.
- **Verification:** The `head()` method is used to check the standardized string values.


**Next Steps**

- The instructor indicates that the next lesson will focus on deeper data exploration to understand the content and relationships within the dataset.


**Summary**

This lesson covered the initial steps in preparing a dataset for a car price prediction project. The main focus was on cleaning and standardizing the column names and string values within the DataFrame to ensure consistency and easier data manipulation in subsequent steps.


**Potential Areas for Further Exploration**

- **Data Exploration Techniques:** Research various techniques for exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Pandas and other libraries. 
- **Feature Engineering:** Explore potential features that could be derived from the existing data to improve model performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Learn how to create visualizations to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships between features.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Understand strategies for dealing with missing data in the dataset.


**Relevant Questions**

- What are other common data cleaning tasks that might be necessary for different types of datasets?
- How can we assess the quality of the data after cleaning and standardization?
- What are the implications of not standardizing data before using it for machine learning?
- How can we automate some of the data cleaning steps to make the process more efficient? 

## 03 Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Distribution

**Session overview:**

This lesson focuses on understanding the data through exploratory data analysis and examining the distribution of car prices, particularly focusing on the presence and handling of a long tail distribution.

**Data exploration:**

* The dataset contains information about cars, including:
    * Manufacturer
    * Model
    * Year
    * Engine type
    * Engine horsepower
    * Number of cylinders
    * Transmission type
    * Driven wheels
    * Highway MPG
    * City MPG
    * Popularity (based on Twitter mentions)
    * MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price - the target variable)

* Each column is analyzed for:
    * Data type (string or numerical)
    * Unique values
    * Number of unique values

* This initial exploration helps understand the type and range of values for each feature.

**Price Distribution Analysis:**

* A histogram is used to visualize the distribution of car prices (`MSRP` column).
* The initial histogram reveals a long tail distribution, with:
    * Most cars concentrated at lower price points.
    * A long, shallow tail extending towards very high prices, representing a small number of very expensive cars.

* Long tail distributions are common for prices, reflecting the market dynamics with many affordable items and few luxury items.

**Challenges of Long Tail Distributions:**

* Long tail distributions can negatively affect machine learning models by:
    * Confusing the model due to the skewed data.
    * Overemphasizing the rare, high-priced items.

**Addressing the Long Tail:**

* Logarithmic transformation is applied to the price (`MSRP`) column using the `np.log1p` function:
    * This function adds 1 to all values before taking the logarithm, handling potential zero values.
    * Logarithmic transformation compresses the high price range, reducing the tail's influence.
* The resulting histogram shows a distribution resembling a normal distribution, with a clear center and symmetrical decline on both sides.
* This transformation benefits machine learning models as:
    * Models perform better with normal-like distributions.
    * The transformed data avoids the model being confused by the extreme values in the long tail.

**Missing Values:**

* The dataset contains missing values represented as "NaN" in various columns, including fuel type, market category, and horsepower.
* The `df.isnull().sum()` function identifies the number of missing values in each column.
* These missing values need to be addressed before training the machine learning model.

**Summary:**

* The session covered exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
* The distribution of car prices was examined, highlighting the presence and handling of a long tail distribution.
* Logarithmic transformation was used to improve the distribution for better model performance.
* Missing values were identified and noted for future handling.

**Next Steps:**

* The next lesson will focus on setting up a validation framework. This is essential for evaluating the model's performance and ensuring accurate predictions.

**Potential Questions for Further Exploration:**

* How can we handle the missing values in the dataset?
* What other methods are available for dealing with long tail distributions in data?
* What are the different validation frameworks used in machine learning, and how do they work? 
* What are the specific challenges of applying machine learning to price prediction tasks?
