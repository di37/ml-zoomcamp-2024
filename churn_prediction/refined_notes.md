## Machine Learning Zoomcamp - Week 3: Churn Prediction

### Introduction

**Scenario:**

Imagine working for a Telecom company (Telco 1) that provides services like phone lines, internet, and TV to a large customer base. Naturally, some customers may consider leaving for various reasons, like dissatisfaction with services, better alternatives (e.g., another Telecom company, Telco 2), or simply stopping service usage altogether.

**Goal:**

* Identify customers likely to churn (stop using the company's services).
* Assign a churn probability score (between 0 and 1) to each customer.
* Target high-risk customers with promotional offers (e.g., discounts) to prevent churn.

**Example:**

Customers are assigned churn probability scores based on their individual characteristics and behavior. A score of 0.20 represents a low churn likelihood, while a score of 0.85 indicates a high likelihood of the customer leaving.

**Challenges:**

* **Accuracy is crucial:** Avoid offering discounts to customers unlikely to churn (loss of revenue).
* **Avoid missing high-risk customers:** Ensure effective targeting of promotional efforts.

### Binary Classification Approach

**Machine Learning Approach:**

This problem can be addressed using Binary Classification, a type of Supervised Machine Learning algorithm. 

**Data Representation:**

* **Target Variable (Y):** Represents whether a customer churned or not.
    * 1: Positive example (customer churned).
    * 0: Negative example (customer did not churn).
* **Feature Vector (X):** Represents customer information, such as demographics, payment history, services used, contract details, etc.

**Formula for a Single Observation:**

```
Y_i = f(X_i)
```

Where:

* `X_i` is the feature vector for customer `i`.
* `Y_i` is the target variable (0 or 1) indicating whether customer `i` churned.
* `f` is the model that maps features to the churn prediction.

**Model Output:**

The model outputs a score (G) between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of customer `i` churning:

```
G(X_i) = probability of churn for customer i
```

### Building the Churn Prediction Model

**Data Source:**

The project will utilize a dataset from Kaggle: "Telco Customer Churn". This dataset contains information about telecom customers, including various features and a "Churn" column indicating whether they left the company.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Download and Preparation:** Download the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps.
2. **Validation Framework:** Set up a validation framework using Scikit-learn (instead of manual implementation with Pandas and NumPy).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the data, focusing on the target variable (churn) and its relationship with other features.
4. **Feature Importance Analysis:** Determine which features are most significant in predicting churn (e.g., customer demographics, service usage patterns).
5. **Churn Rate and Risk Ratio Calculation:** Explore churn rates for different customer segments and calculate risk ratios to identify high-risk groups.
6. **Mutual Information and Correlation Analysis:** Use these metrics to further understand the relationships between features and churn.
7. **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Utilize Scikit-learn's encoding techniques to handle categorical features.
8. **Logistic Regression Model:** Implement a Logistic Regression model (using Scikit-learn) to predict churn.
9. **Model Comparison:** Compare Logistic Regression with Linear Regression to assess performance.
10. **Model Interpretation:** Analyze the model's coefficients to understand the influence of each feature on churn prediction.
11. **Model Deployment:** Utilize the trained model to score existing customers and target high-risk individuals with promotional emails.


### Conclusion

This week's project involves building a churn prediction model using a real-world dataset and applying machine learning techniques to identify and target at-risk customers. The project will leverage Scikit-learn for various tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Follow-up

**Potential Areas for Further Exploration:**

* Investigate different classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines) and compare their performance for churn prediction.
* Explore advanced feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
* Implement strategies for model deployment and monitoring in a real-world setting.
* Research methods for evaluating the effectiveness of churn prevention campaigns.

**Relevant Questions:**

* How can imbalanced datasets (where one class, e.g., churned customers, is significantly smaller than the other) be addressed in churn prediction?
* What are the ethical considerations involved in using machine learning to predict and influence customer behavior?
* How can the churn prediction model be adapted to handle new data and changing customer patterns?
* What are the potential business benefits of implementing a successful churn prediction system?
